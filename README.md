# Dirac's Billiard

Hello! My name is Rafael and in this repository I perform numerical simulations to calculate properties of electrical transport in Dirac's billiard such as conductance, power shot noise, concurrence, the entanglement of formation, and violations of Bell's inequality. All of the results of this repository can be found in the jupyter notebook's files of the directory "/Chiral/Data_Analysis". Dirac's billiard is a type of quantum billiard used to describe a system with chiral/sub-lattice symmetry. Systems with chiral symmetry can be found in single-layer graphene quantum billiard, illiustrated in the Figure 1 from the thesis [[1]](#1) that produces the reference [[2]](#2).

The difference between Schrödinger and Dirac billiards remains mainly in the electron behavior described by the Schrödinger and Dirac equations, respectively. Moreover, the dimension of hamiltonian and coupling matrix between lead and cavity are double due to the chiral/sub-lattice degree of freedom.
