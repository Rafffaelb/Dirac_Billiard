# Dirac's Billiard

Hello! My name is Rafael and in this repository I perform numerical simulations to calculate properties of electrical transport in Dirac's billiard such as conductance, power shot noise, concurrence, the entanglement of formation, and violations of Bell's inequality. All of the results of this repository can be found in the jupyter notebook's files of the directory "/Chiral/Data_Analysis".
